# Tachyons Extra

> All of the css functional classes that are not included in the original Tachyons

## Install

```sh
yarn add tachyons-extra
```

## Usage

If you're using webpack, import the module at the root of your project, just under the original `tachyons`

```js
import 'tachyons'
import 'tachyons-extra'
```

Otherwise you can use it from the CDN, put this in your html

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons-extra/tachyons-extra.css">
```
